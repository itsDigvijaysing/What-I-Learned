- #NodeJS is Server-Side JavaScript Runtime
- We normally use it to run JS code outside the Browser
- We can also execute server side logic

## Node Files

The `node_modules` folder is a directory in a Node.js project where npm (Node Package Manager) stores the packages (libraries, frameworks, etc.) that your project depends on. These dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file.

In a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project, the `node_modules` folder can exist in multiple places:

1. In the root directory of your project: This `node_modules` folder contains the packages needed by your Express.js server (like express, mongoose, etc.).
    
2. Inside the client directory: If you're using Create React App or a similar tool to manage your React.js application, you'll have a separate `package.json` file and a `node_modules` folder inside your client directory. This `node_modules` folder contains the packages needed by your React.js application (like react, react-dom, etc.).

`package.json` and `package-lock.json` are both important files in a Node.js project, but they serve different purposes:

1. `package.json`: This file holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. It can include properties like:
    
    - `name` and `version`: The name and version of your application.
    - `scripts`: Command shortcuts that you can use to run tasks on your application.
    - `dependencies` and `devDependencies`: The packages your project depends on.
2. `package-lock.json`: This is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates. This file allows you to share your workspace with others without needing to re-download the entire `node_modules` directory.

In summary, `package.json` is used to manage and identify project properties and dependencies, while `package-lock.json` is used to lock down the exact versions of the installed dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.
