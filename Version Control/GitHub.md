## GitHub Copilot

- If we use ==comment q : Question== then there will be answer for that question in comment.
```py
	// q: what is arrow function in javascript?
	// a: Arrow functions are a more concise way of writing a function in JavaScript. They are written using the => syntax.
```
- ==ctrl+shift+I== opens shortcut for Copilot & we can chat with it.
- when receiving the suggestions we can change between them using ==ctrl+arrowkey== & If we enter ==Ctrl+Enter== we can see all suggestion in different Tab.
- Fix It, Explain the selected Code & Check Error message from terminal all things can be automated using Copilot
- Copilot can also generate the GitHub commit Message of what changes we have done, so far.
- ==@Workspace== Agent, when we chat with github when we give @Workshpace then it will check that code & give answer based on our current project code. e.g. Workspace (Total VSCode Project)
- You can also ask reference & find something in your code like function or anything.
- ==@vscode== Agent, if you don't know any shortcut of vscode or say you don't know some settings, you can just ask that to Copilot using **@vscode** agent..
- Multiple new things are added ==# Context== & ==/ new==, check for new things.
- We can ask to perform tasks based on selected code, like if you select a button you can just command it to give bootstrap button design & it will give you the code based on selected code.
- Copilot have `restriction` so it can not response back very long data, so sometimes we need to ask our code in small chunks of code & then combine it.
