# TIN - 01
In this subject We are understanding how the data from your phone to the server reach with all the hardware knowledge.

Some important things
1. Cloud computing
2. Hardware aspects of this thing.

 we have 3 Main things
 - SAAS → Online photoshop, fully online tool
 - PAAS → Online storage unit, your software work on there platform
 - IAAS → EC2 instances {full control of infrastructure } 

Software defined Networks:
Our goal is to understand current generation & next generation networking in the cloud / datacenter.
We will also have hand's on experience in development & deployment of cloud native application.
