# TIN - 01
In this subject We are understanding how the data from your phone to the server reach with all the hardware knowledge.

Some important things
1. Cloud computing
2. Hardware aspects of this thing.

 we have 3 Main things
 - SAAS → Online photoshop, fully online tool
 - PAAS → Online storage unit, your software work on there platform
 - IAAS → EC2 instances {full control of infrastructure } 

Software defined Networks:
Our goal is to understand current generation & next generation networking in the cloud / datacenter.
We will also have hand's on experience in development & deployment of cloud native application.

Grading policy
- attendance →5% {bonus}
- prog. Assignment →40%

# TIN - 04
## Systems for ML
- Early ML Foundation started due to:
	1. Rise of Deep Neural Nets
	2. Higher Data availablility
	3. Power Hardware
- Current ML Restrictions:
	- Difficult to Manage the Servers
	- Un-Optimised Model require high compute power and working similar to doing brute-force for something.
	- High Power Usage & Cost of Infrastructure.
- Systems for ML & Stateful Data & Firewall
