### **Temporary Plan :** [[Week_plan (7->12 Oct)]]
### **Improvement Plan**

- **Core Focus on Algorithms:** Revise key algorithms (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, trees) and practice daily.
- **Real-World Problems:** After learning a new concept, solve **3 application-oriented problems** from LeetCode or Codeforces.
- **Weekly Mock Tests:** Take a full-length mock test weekly and analyze mistakes thoroughly to identify weaknesses.
- **Daily Proof Practice:** Write formal proofs and loop invariants for at least one problem each day.
- **Review Pattern Recognition:** After solving each problem, review and identify patterns and where else you’ve seen them.
- **Clarify Key Concepts:** Revisit key topics in Advanced Computer Networks; break down each concept to understand its purpose and use cases.
- **Understand Exam Question Language:** Practice reading exam-style questions and dissect them to identify key terms and requirements.
- **Practical Applications:** Use real-world tools like Cisco Packet Tracer to see how concepts work in practical scenarios.
- **Improve Presentation:** Structure answers with Intro → Explanation → Practical Example/Diagram; write in clear, structured points.
- **Get Feedback:** Regularly show your answers to peers or TAs to ensure clarity in explanations.
- **Complete Tasks Early:** Finish all preparations at least a day before deadlines to avoid last-minute stress.
- **Group Formulas:** Group formulas by concept; practice with real examples and review them regularly.
