- **network security first lecture** 
- **Introduction & logistic**

Why should we learn network Security.
- digital dependency → Industry dependent on interconnected systems
- cyber threat → phishing sites, ransomware Etc
- skills gap

 benefit of Expertise
 - career opportunity
 - critical role
 - personal safety

Real World impact
- real World impact
	- financial loss
	- data breaches
- increasing attack vectors
	- IOT devices
	- remote work → attack can happen on home network as well.

Role of security expert
- detect threat
- prevent threat
- responds to threat
- educate & enforce

Objective
- foundation for network security
- monitor & analysis of network traffic ( In C++ we can use libpcap & for python. we can use Scapy )
- understand how to fix things.

Prerequisites
- CN, socket prog, shell scripting , preferred C / C++/ py 

Grading policy
- class participation → 5%
- quizzes → 10%
- mid sem exam → 10%
- end sem → 15%
- assignment project → 60% / 70% ( CTF / VAPT / prog asg / project )

**The security problems**
	- lots of buggy software
	- social engineering is very effective
	- money making using vulnerabilities

- Buffer Overflow (with sample code)
![](Buffer%20Overflow.png)

Attacked will try to get the IP address & bandwidth stealing
- it helps them to act as random user.
- they can start attack through the owned devices.

 steal the user credentials & inject ads.
 - using keylogs & silent banker.
 - they can also create side where w=vv & L = 1 in domain names.

- cybersecurity → some part of security domain.
- focus → CIA- confidentiality, integrity, availability.

Application Security → keep software & device secure
Information security → data integrity & privacy. { both intransit & rest. }
Network security. → controlling & securing network from attacker.
Disaster recovery & business continuity plan.
Operational security → handling & protecting data asset 

Alice & Bob & Trudy. {Alice → Client, Bob →server . Trudy → intruder }
What bad person can do→ eaves drop, hijack the network, impersonate, etc.

**In security we have two different encryption types.**
1. Symmetric encryption {some key both side}
2. Asymmetric encryption {public key private key }

**Privacy = identity and data**

**threat model**
A structured approach to identity, assess, & mitigate securing risk associated with a system & application
Key elements → assets, threat, vulnerability, mitigation.
- types of attacker :-
- individual { outsider, insider, trusted / privileged user }
- group {adhoc - establish }
- organization { competitor, supplier, partner }
- state or state sponsored.

**active attack** {direct participate & data manipulation}
**Passive attack** { only view collect the data & don't interfare }

# NS - 03
- Type of cipher text and how we can decrypt them and there vulnerabilities.
- we learned about the mono alphabetic and multi substitution cipher.
- we learned about different types of attack for decryption.
