# Lambdas Functions in Python
Lambdas are one line functions. They are also known as anonymous functions in some other languages. You might want to use lambdas when you donâ€™t want to use a function twice in a program. They are just like normal functions and even behave like them.

```python3
def square(x):
    return x * x
# But Lamdas are totally different

square = lambda x:x*x
print(square(2))
# You can also store lamda inside of a variable
# In this case we are passing x as an parameter. Basically they are short and # anonymous functions
# Lambdas don't have a name'
```

#### Map() function in Lambdas
* It's a standard function that accepts at least two arguements a function and an iterable
* Iterable can be lists tuples or dictionary
* Runs lambda for each value and then returns
```python3
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
x = map(lambda x:x*x,nums)
print(list(x))
# This shows how map() function works. We are passing lamda function that will square each number in the list nums
```

#### filter() Function
* It takes a list/tuple and filters based on the given condition
* The lambda function needs to be a boolean it can be either true or false
```python3
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
names = ['alex','john','aneesa','aidan','amina','jill','jackson']
data = [
  {'username' : 'alex_1'},
  {'username' : 'axis_07'},
  {'username' : 'aaa'},
  {'username' : 'asthetic'},
  {'username' : 'bob'},
  {'username' : 'jason_07'},
  {'username' : 'razer_07'},
  {'username' : 'pythonista'}
]
# A function that will print the usernames with more than 4 characters
usernames = list(filter(lambda u:len(u['username']) > 4 , data))
for name in usernames:
  print(name['username'])

# A new list with the multiples of two and less than 10
print('\n')
new_list = list(map(lambda num: num*2, filter(lambda num: num < 6   ,x)))
print(new_list)
print('\n')
for nums in new_list:
  print(nums)

# filter names starting with J and adding them to group 1 and names starting with a goes to group_2

group_1 = filter(lambda n:n[0]=='j',names)
print(list(group_1))

group_2 = filter(lambda n:n[0]=='a',names)
print(list(group_2))

# We can also use the list comprehension but it's better to understand how the map() and filter() works
```

#### Any() and all() built in function
* all() takes the iterables and return of they are true or not
```python
list = [1,2,3,4]
all(list)
#This will return true since all the values are true
# You can also check if all numbers are divisible by two in list
```

Lets say you want to check if every name started in the list with the character C

```python
list = ['Casey','Charlie','Courtney','Cashmere']
x = [name[0] == 'C' for name in list]
print(all(x))
#This will return True since every name starts with C
```

Generator Expressions
- They are less memory consuming.
- Readmore on [List vs Generators](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47789/generator-expressions-vs-list-comprehension)
- 
```python
#A small test \
import sys
list_comp = sys.getsizeof([x for x in range(10)])
gen = sys.getsizeof((x for x in range(10)))
print(f'The mem usage of a list {list_comp} and mem usage of gen {gen}')
```

### Sorted
- This is built in python function that can be used to sort elements in the list or tuple.

```python
x = [7,4,5,2,12]
y = sorted(x,reverse=True)
```
This will sort the list.

Another Example let say we have a dictionary of users and want to sort them.

```python
data = [
{
#
'name':'John',
'class':7,
},
{
'name':'Zayn',
'class':2,
},
{
'name':'Aquaman',
'class':11,
},
{
'name':'Tony',
'class':12,
},
{
'name':'Harry',
'class':5
}
  
]

sorted_dict = sorted(data,key=lambda user:user['class'])

print(sorted_dict) 
```

### Min and Max Function

- This is simple function that returns min or max in the list or tuple.

```python
a = min([1,2,3,4,5])
print(a)
# This returns 1
# if we do max
b = max([1,2,3,4,5])
print(b)
```

### Reverse
- This function reverses list,string or a iterator

```python
x = [1,2,3,4,5]
x.reverse()
# This will reverse a list

for char in reversed("Hello"):
  print(char)
# This will print out reversed hello
```


### Extras
- `abs()` this will return the absolute value.
- `sum()` this will sum a iterable like a list or tuple.
- `round()` This is going to round the number.

```python
x = -10
abs(x) # this is going to print 10
d = [1,2,3,4,5]
sum(d) # This will print the sum of the list.
f = 10.5
round(f) #This will print 11
```

### Zip() 

- Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
- Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th elements from each of the arguement sequences or iterables.
- the iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

```python
x = [1,2,3]
y= [4,5,6]
zip(x,y)
# This will print(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)
# We can also convert it to a dictionary 
dict(zip(x,y))
```
